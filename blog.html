                <li class="text-xl font-medium">Discuss the scope of var, let, and const?</li><br>
                <p class="text-lg text-justify">Var: var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped. It can be updated. It also a re-declared variables. var can be declared without being initialized.</p><br>
                <p class="text-lg text-justify">let: let declaration are block scoped. It can be updated but not re-declared. let can be declared without being initialized. </p><br>
                <p class="text-lg">const: const declaration are block scoped. It can not be updated and re-declared. const must be initialized during declaration. </p> <br>
                <li class="text-xl font-medium">Tell us the use cases of null and undefined?</li><br>
                    <p class="text-lg text-justify">null: null means an empty value or a blank value. The data type of null is an object. In arithmetic operations null will be converted to 0 behind the screens. In conditional logic null will return false</p> <br>
                    <p class="text-lg text-justify">undefined: undefined means the variable has been declared, but its value has not been assigned.The data type of undefined is undefined. In conditional logic undefined will return false. undefined is not an assignment value,  as there is no value assigned to the variable, it becomes undefined. </p> <br>
                
                <li class="text-xl font-medium">What do you mean by REST API?</li><br>
                <p class="text-lg text-justify">REST API: A REST API is an API that conforms to the design principles of the REST, or representational state transfer architectural style. <br> When a client request is made via a REST API, it transfers a representation of the state of the resource to the requester or endpoint. This information, or representation, is delivered in one of several formats via HTTP: JSON, HTML, XLT, Python, PHP, or plain text. JSON is the most generally popular file format to use because, despite its name, it’s language-agnostic, as well as readable by both humans and machines. </p>
